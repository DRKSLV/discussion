The Heroku-Url is the Backend Application that actually stores the Data and collects Logfiles.\r\n\r\nYou can reach out to me on privacy issues at konrad.gruber@protonmail.ch\r\n\r\n## What Data do I collect?\r\n\r\n#### Log-Files\r\nDRKSLV-Discussion follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analysing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.\r\n\r\n#### User-Account\r\nWhen you register a User-Account with me, I store:\r\n    • A pseudonymous Username\r\n    • Your email address\r\n    • whether you have verified your email address \r\n    • whether you have been granted Moderator-Rights\r\n    • your password in encrypted form (bcrypt hashing algorithm)\r\n    • date and time of creation\r\n    • date and time of last edit\r\n\r\nOnly your Username, Moderator-Rights and the Date of Creation will be shown publicly.  This Information is used to provide a public Identity to the People using our site. Your email address and Password are used to prove your identity.\r\nI reserve my right to terminate your User-Account at any Time, for any Reason.\r\n\r\n#### Posts, Comments and Votes\r\nYou can choose to participate in discussion on my Platform.\r\nThis takes the form of creating Posts, Comments and Voting on other Users contributions.\r\n\r\nYour Posts and Comments store their Creation and Edit Timestamps, as well as their author (which associates them with your account) \r\nPosts have a title and a text body, Comments only have the text.\r\nComments store their position in the comment hierarchy and which post they belong to.\r\n\r\nYou can edit and correct the text body of posts and comments.\r\n\r\nWhen you delete a post or comment, it is de-associated with your account and the text-body will be deleted. However, post titles and comment hierarchies will be persisted to provide context to other users contributions that were replying to your post or comment.\r\n\r\nBecause titles are persisted, please don’t use them to convey sensitive personal data!\r\nVotes store the date and time you voted, the content you were voting on, and are associated with your account. You can withdraw a vote at any time, and when you delete your account all your votes will be lost as well.\r\n\r\n## What Data do I collect?\r\nI collect Log Files when you visit my website or access features of the underlying application.\r\n\r\nI collect User-Account Information, when you choose to register an account with me.\r\n\r\nI collect Post, Comment or Vote Information whenever you voluntarily choose to create them.\r\n\r\n## How will I use your Data?\r\nI collect your data so I can:\r\n\r\n- Analyse traffic and use of my website and application (I don't rlly bother tho)\r\n- Manage your account and provide a virtual Identity for you\r\n- Create a space were people can share content and vote on or reply to it\r\n- Email you critical notices via email (will never happen prlly)\r\n\r\n## How do I store your data?\r\nI store your data on a free instance of heroku-postgres. \r\nYour User-Accounts password is encrypted securely using the bcrypt hashing algorithm.\r\nThe Database is locked with an username and password based authentication system. Username and Password were chosen entirely randomly and are of sufficient length to prevent brute-force attacks.\r\n\r\nI keep your User Information, Posts, Comments and Votes for as long as you desire.\r\n\r\nI keep log files indefinitely.\r\n(I actually don't know how long they are kept, but I don't care, so I just reserve my right to hold onto them, since they do not contain sensitive data)\r\n\r\n## Marketing (none)\r\nYour Information is not shared with any third-parties. I do not run ads or track unauthenticated users on the Website.\r\nSo there is basically no Marketing going on here.\r\n\r\n## What are your data protection rights?\r\nI would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following:\r\nThe right to access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data. \r\nThe right to rectification – You have the right to request that I correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request Our Company to complete the information you believe is incomplete.\r\n(You can just edit your user-account info, you do not have the right to rectify other peoples posts etc.)\r\nThe right to erasure – You have the right to request that I erase your personal data, under certain conditions.\r\nThe right to restrict processing – You have the right to request that I restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.\r\nThe right to object to processing – You have the right to object to my processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.\r\nThe right to data portability – You have the right to request that I transfer the data that i have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.\r\nIf you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.

Local Storage cannot be turned off. However disabling JavaScript in your Browser will stop us from accessing it.\r\nIf you turn of JavaScript, Website Functionality will break.\r\n\r\n## Privacy of external Sites\r\nMy Website contains links to other websites. Our privacy policy applies only to our website, so if you click on a link to another website, you should read their privacy policy. \r\n\r\n## Changes to my privacy policy\r\nI keep my privacy policy under regular review and place any updates on this web page. This privacy policy was last updated on 8th May 2020. \r\n\r\n## Contacting appropriate authorities\r\nIf you feel I violate the GDPR you can report that to a EU Authority. However I don’t know how to contact them and I’m fucking tired of this shit so please do your research yourself.\r\nAlso contact me using the Email in Section 1 first if you believe I can easily resolve the issue.\r\nPls don't get me in jail I’m a god damn 17 year old.\r\n");
